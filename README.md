# Single Cycle circuit
electrical circuit university project 

This project receives 3 entries in the first window:
- Main circuit voltage
- Mainstream Circuit
- Number of resistors

user can leave one of the two **voltage** or **current** values blank, in which case the program will calculate it.
In the second window, the **number of resistors** in the circuit must be entered.
In the next window, the program calculates all the unknown values.
